Pseudo code for card game

Rules:
It is illegal to cheat, for example: looking at your opponent's cards, looking through the the stack of cards on the side.
If a player has a higher value card than the other player, he/she has the choice of making his/her opponent/opponents take the center pile of cards or pick up 2 cards from the side deck. 
The point of the game is to have zero cards left first. Which ever player has discards all their cards first, wins the game.
It is the opposite of War.

     (4)  Place a card at the center of both players;

       

         (6)  Start the games by flipping a coin to determine who will put the second card on the center;

            (7)  <<Player1>> must place a <<card center>> that is similar in suit or in number to the <<center card>>;

               (8)  If <<Player1>> puts a card that is higher <<value>>, player 2 must either pick up two <<cards> from the <<side deck>> or pick up all the center pile;

                 (9)If  <<Player2>> chooses to take the center pile, than <<Player2>> gets one extra card.,
                    else, <<Player2>> gets all the cards in the center pile, and the center pile resets.}


(11)If <<Player2>> places a matching card with similar signs;
    (12)and  <<Player1>> does not have a matching card to <<Player2>>â€™s card;

                                         Repeat until one player has no remaining cards;
