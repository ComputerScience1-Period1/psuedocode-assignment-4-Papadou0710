Pseudo code for card game

Rules of the game:
It is illegal to cheat, for example: looking at your opponent's cards, looking through the the stack of cards on the side.
If a player has a higher value card than the other player, he/she has the choice of making his/her opponent/opponents take the center pile of cards or pick up 2 cards from the side deck. 
The point of the game is to have zero cards left first. Which ever player has discards all their cards first, wins the game.
It is the opposite of War.

First three rounds:

(1)  Load game;
    players = player1 +player2
 (2)  Identify 2 players ;
          cards = (10-54)
   (3)  Distribute 5 <<cards>> to <<players>> at random, from the top of the pile;
          center card = 44-1
     (4)  Place a card at the center of both players;

       

         (6)  Start the games by flipping a coin to determine who will put the second card on the center;

            (7)  If{ <<Player1>> is chosen, they must place a <<card center>> that is similar in suit or in number to the <<center card>>; // what if they don't have a card that meets these conditions?
                /* 
                if( <<Player1>> does NOT have a valid card) {
                    <<Player1>> pick up two <<cards>> from side pile;
                }
                */
               (8)  <<Player1>> puts a card that is higher <<value>>, which forces player 2 to either pick up two <<cards> from the side pile or pick up all the center pile;

                 (9)  <<Player2>> chooses to take the center pile;}

(10) if{ player2 starts

(11) <<Player2>> places a matching card with similar signs;

(12)  <<Player1>> does not have a matching card to <<Player2>>â€™s card;

(13)   <<Player1>> has to pick up two <<cards>> from the side pile;}

                                         Repeat until one player has no remaining cards;
