Pseudo code for card game

Rules of the game:
It is illegal to cheat, for example: looking at your opponent's cards, looking through the the stack of cards on the side.
If a player has a higher value card than the other player, he/she has the choice of making his/her opponent/opponents take the center pile of cards or pick up 2 cards from the side deck. 
The point of the game is to have zero cards left first. Which ever player has discards all their cards first, wins the game.
It is the opposite of War.

(4)  Place a card at the center of both players
(5)  Flip the center card so the card is identified

(7)  If Player 1 is chosen, they must place a card at the center that is similar in suit or in number to the center card
(8)  Player 1 puts a card that is higher value, which forces player 2 to either pick up two cards from the side pile or pick up all the center pile.
